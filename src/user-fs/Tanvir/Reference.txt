Hi Denise/ Andy, 

Thanks for your email. I have been Tanvir's TA for two classes over the course of his time at Carleton University. In that time, he has proven himself to be a bright student, and a responsible and mature individual. I remember him as always being very punctual and well prepared in all my interactions with him, in addition to being very empathic. In this regard, I have no qualms about recommending him for the position-- from what I gather, it entails his being a role model to young people, and I am sure he will excel at that. 

Feel free to contact me for further details. 

Regards, 
Ameera Alam

Goodmorning Denise/ Andy, 

I am currently the President of the Carleton University Bangladeshi Students Association and, as such, have worked closely with Tanvir for the last three years. He has often volunteered to perform at our events, and has consistently proven that he possesses strong leadership skills in addition to being a talented musician. On occasions that required long rehearsals that went late into the night (due to the proximity of upcoming CUBSA shows), Tanvir proved that he can withstand stressful situations well. I personally think that he really came into his own at those times. I think he'll make a great counselor because of this ability.
